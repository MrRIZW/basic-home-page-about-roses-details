    <p><h1>History of red rose</h1><br>Red roses are one of the most widely cultivated flowers in the world. According to the fossil record, we can trace the history of the rose back 35 million years. Most species we know today originated in Asia, as roughly 5,000 years ago garden cultivation of roses began in China. The blooms and seeds were then traded all over the world. Throughout the centuries they have been part of mythology, medicine, and even war.

        In Western culture, the significance of the red rose dates back to Greek mythology and the belief that the red rose was created by Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love. Legend has it that the flower grew from the ground watered with Aphrodites tears and the blood of her ill-fated lover Adonis. Moving onto Roman mythology, the creation of red roses has been linked to Venus, the Goddess of Love. As Venus was running to warn her lover, Adonis, about a murder plot against him, she cut her ankles when she ran through a thorn bush. Her blood then turned into blooming red roses whenever it touches.</p>
