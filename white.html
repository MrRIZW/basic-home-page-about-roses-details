    <h1>History of white rose</h1>
    <p>The White Rose was founded in 1942 by several students at the University of Munich, including Sophie Scholl and her brother Hans. The members were united against Nazi policies and began writing and distributing leaflets calling on the German people to take action to stop injustice and genocide. In 1943, Hans and Sophie Scholl were arrested by the Gestapo after they distributed leaflets to students at their university. Hans Scholl, Sophie Scholl, and Christoph Probst, another member of the group, were executed on February 22, 1943. Since then, the White Rose, and Sophie Scholl specifically, have become a symbol of resistance during WWII.

        This program examines Sophie Scholl and the White Rose with Wolfgang Huber, the son of White Rose member Kurt Huber and Professor Emeritus at the Catholic University of Eichst√§tt-Ingolstad; Frank McDonough, author of Sophie Scholl: The Real Story of the Woman Who Defied Hitler; and Nathan Stoltzfus, the Dorothy and Jonathan Rintels Professor of Holocaust Studies at Florida State University. The conversation is moderated by Lori Weintrob, Professor of History at Wagner College and founding director of the Wagner College Holocaust Center. </p>
