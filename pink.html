    <h1>History of pink rose</h1>
    <p>Pink roses can convey joy or a sense of happiness that is soft, welcoming, or comforting. For this reason, pink rose arrangements are often exchanged between friends and family members - the blooms are simple expressions that we want another person to be happy. This might stem from the origins of pink roses as they are the main varietal of rose from which all other modern-day roses were created. Pink roses are also versatile when you have something important to convey.

        A fascinating fact about these roses is that in ancient Hebrew texts, it is written that pink roses are the only flowers permitted inside the walls of the city of Jerusalem, largely because they were the only roses of the time. Their spiraling petals represented a journey towards perfection.

        Also, there were roses of different colors in the past, and pink rosesâ€™ symbolism throughout the world often reflected a desire to give the most beautiful flower in nature, a gift that is selfless and pure    </p>
